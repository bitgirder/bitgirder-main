- parser tree doesn't need explicit type reference source locs now that
  CompletableTypeReference has them itself

- consider adding MingleIdentifier, MingleNamespace as addressable value types 

- add tests for parenthesized type expressions

- add checked constructors for creating type references from outside mg package
  (CreateAtomicUnsafe..., etc)
