- move mingle-interpreter into mingle-compiler as an internal const evaluator

- (compiler) disallow cyclic ns dependencies (equivalent to disallowing cyclic
  imports)

- (compiler/types) disallow duplicate constructor types and constructor types of
  SymbolMap (sym map is ambiguous when used with a cast reactor that infers
  structs on symbol maps)

- (mingle io) add failure checks for invalid id part strings
