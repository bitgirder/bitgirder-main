- make Timestamp a numeric type

- add structure reactor checks that enforce that the value following an
  allocation have the type specified, and that list values are of the correct
  type

- ensure that Buffer.String() prints at most N leading/trailing hex chars, but
  does not attempt to hexify an enormous buffer (can always add
  Buffer.HexString() for callers that actually want that).
